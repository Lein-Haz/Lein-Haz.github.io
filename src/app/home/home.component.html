      This site
    </h4>
    <p>
      So why is this site here?  Well, not only to showcase my skills, but a few other reasons.
      I've never really built a site for myself that I put online, so that was part of it.  I've also been wanting to play around with
      Oauth, which was fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the primary thing I wanted to play around with is Progressive Web Apps and this
      site is a PWA.  So go visit some pages let the service worker cache things up and try coming back when you are offline.
    </p>
    <p class="small-text">
      *Disclaimer* The page sections with google maps won't work when you are offline, as you do need an active
      connection to load map data.

      Fullstack developer with experience in web and mobile applications development.  This site should look good on anything except Internet Explorer.
      Though there might still be some Firefox display bugs to go through.
